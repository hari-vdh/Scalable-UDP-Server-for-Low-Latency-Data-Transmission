## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started, follow these steps to install the server on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Docker (optional, but recommended)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hari-vdh/Scalable-UDP-Server-for-Low-Latency-Data-Transmission.git
cd Scalable-UDP-Server-for-Low-Latency-Data-Transmission
```

### Install Dependencies

Use pip to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running with Docker

If you prefer to run the server using Docker, you can build and run the Docker image with:

```bash
docker build -t scalable-udp-server .
docker run -p 8080:8080 scalable-udp-server
```

---

## Usage üìä

Once you have installed the server, you can start using it to transmit humidity data.

### Starting the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will listen for incoming UDP packets on the specified port.

### Sending Data

You can send data to the server using any UDP client. Here is a simple example using Python:

```python
import socket

UDP_IP = "127.0.0.1"
UDP_PORT = 8080
MESSAGE = b"Humidity: 45%"

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.sendto(MESSAGE, (UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))
```

### Viewing Logs

Logs are saved in the `logs` directory. You can view the logs to monitor data transmission and server performance.

---

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The server configuration is stored in a `config.json` file. You can modify the following settings:

- **host**: The IP address the server will listen on.
- **port**: The port number for incoming data.
- **log_level**: The level of logging (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING).

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 8080,
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

---

## Testing üß™

We provide a set of tests to ensure the server operates as expected. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

You can add your own tests in the `tests` directory.
